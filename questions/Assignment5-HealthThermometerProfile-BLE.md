*Be sure to take measurements in the "Default" configuration of the profiler to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See [Shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ro9G2Nsr_ZXDhBYJ6YyF9CPivb--6UjhHRmVhDGySag/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions.*

4. Provide screen shot showing the connection interval settings. Do they match the values you set in your slave(server) code or the master's values?.
   
   Answer : We set the connection interval setting on the slave to be 75ms (minimum and maximum). The screenshot shows I got a connection interval of  72.60 ms.
